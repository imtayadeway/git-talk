* Is this a Unit Test?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  it "quacks" do
    duck = Duck.new(:name => "Stewart")
    expect(duck.speak).to eq("Quack")
  end
  #+END_SRC

* Is this a Unit Test?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  it "quacks" do
    duck = Duck.new(:name => "Stewart")
    bread = Bread.new
    expect(duck.feed(bread)).to eq("Quack")
  end
  #+END_SRC

* Is this a Unit Test?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  it "quacks" do
    duck = FactoryGirl.create(:duck)
    expect(duck.speak).to eq("Quack")
  end
  #+END_SRC

* It depends
* Why?
* Testing is new(ish)
* We couldn't decide what the terms meant
* So we made more terms
* All the Terms
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Full Stack Tests
- System Tests
- Acceptance Tests
- Smoke Tests
- Functional Tests
- Contract Tests
- Collaboration Tests

* Two (or three) terms
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- (Test isolation)

* Type A: Units are Classes
- Isolated from other classes
- Stub/Mock collaborators
- Favors Outside-in development
- Integration tests combine different classes working together
* Type A: Units are Classes
- Better test feedback
- Leads to small, clean and well designed interfaces
- Leads to tight coupling between the test and the implementation
- Harder to refactor

* Quote
"But the main lesson I took was that tests should be able to ignore
one another completely. If I had one test broken, I wanted one
problem. If I had two tests broken, I wanted two problems." - Kent Beck

* Type B: Units can be Collections of Related Classes/Methods
- Avoids the use of Mocks
- Favors Middle-out development
- Isolated from changing 'the world' (network, filesystem, etc.)
- Integration tests cross the boundaries
* Quote
"One convenient implication of isolated tests is that the tests are
order independent. If I want to grab a subset of tests and run them,
then I can do so without worrying that a test will break now because
of a prerequisite test is gone." - Kent Beck
* Type B: Units can be Collections of Related Classes/Methods
- Leads to loosely coupled tests
- Easier to refactor
- Less feedback on design of the smaller parts and their interactions
- Prone to cascading failures

* Mockist vs. Classicist
* X on Rails
* Omakase
- Usually departing from the framework is a bad idea
- But I disagree when it comes to testing
* The Test Frameworks

* The Test Pyramid
[[./img/test-pyramid.png]]
* Service Objects
- Business logic is independent from Rails
- Models become simple data objects
* Alternatives
- Hexagonal Rails
- Uncle Bob: Architecture: The Lost Years
- Trailblazer
* Conclusion
- Always define your terms when you're talking about Unit/Integration Testing
- If you're a classicist/mockist or don't know, try another approach
